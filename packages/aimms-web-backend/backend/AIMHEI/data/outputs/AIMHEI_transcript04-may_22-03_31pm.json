The HCP also inquires about any past occurrences of similar symptoms and any recent trauma (lines 18-33). The HCP then summarizes the information gathered to confirm understanding (lines 46).

For example, in line 4, you introduced yourself and your role clearly, which helps establish trust. In lines 6 and 8, you asked for the patient's preferred name, demonstrating respect for their identity. Empathy was well conveyed in line 14, where you acknowledged the patient's discomfort. In line 16, you gently probed for more information about the headache's duration, showing concern without being intrusive. Line 22 was a good example of clarifying the patient's pain severity, which is important for understanding their experience. In line 26, you inquired about additional symptoms in a considerate manner. Line 42 showed you were attentive to what might provide the patient relief. Line 46 was an excellent summary of the patient's condition, which helps ensure you both have a mutual understanding of the situation. Finally, in line 143, you invited the patient to share anything else, showing that you value their input. To enhance your politeness further, consider using more validating statements throughout the interview, such as 'That sounds very challenging' or 'You're doing great by coming in today.' Additionally, ensure you maintain this level of politeness consistently throughout the entire interaction, as it helps build rapport and makes the patient feel valued and heard.",

In line 42, the student acknowledges the temporary relief the patient found in a dark room, which shows understanding of the patient's coping strategies. Line 46 is an excellent example of summarizing the patient's symptoms, which helps the patient feel heard and understood. Line 68 shows the student taking a family history, which can provide context for the patient's condition. Line 72 is empathetic as it shows the student is interested in the patient as a person, not just their symptoms. Line 108 shows the student inquiring about stress at work, which could be a contributing factor to the patient's symptoms. Finally, line 135 shows the student checking on the patient's home environment, which is an important aspect of holistic care. To enhance empathy further, the student could incorporate more reflective statements, such as 'That sounds incredibly challenging' or 'I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.' Additionally, the student could use more comforting language and offer more direct expressions of support, such as 'We're here to support you' or 'I want to make sure we do everything we can to help you feel better.'
