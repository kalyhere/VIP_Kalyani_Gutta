Patient: Come in. Hi.

Doctor: Hello. It's nice to meet you.

Patient: Nice to meet you.

Doctor: My name is John Doe. I'm a 1st year medical student, and I'll be conducting your history today.

Patient: Hi. Hi. I'm Deana.

Doctor: Deana? And, Deana. Can you confirm your full first name and last name and date of birth?

Patient: Sure. My name is Deana Williams, and I was born on 11 I can't remember.

Doctor: No worries.

Patient: I'm 44 years old.

Doctor: Okay. That sounds good. And do you want to

Patient: Go in? I do. Yes.

Doctor: Okay. Sounds good, Deana. So tell me what brings you in today.

Patient: I have the worst headache. I haven't had this bad of headache, and I can't remember. I've never had one this bad.

Doctor: Oh, well, I'm really sorry to hear that. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about today other than headache?

Patient: No.

Doctor: Okay.

Doctor: Just just your headache for today. Okay. So I think what I'm gonna do today is I'll ask you some more questions about your headache, ask you about any associated symptoms you have. And then from there, I ask you just more general questions about the history, your background. And then, from there, we go on to a physical exam. Does that sound good?

Patient: Yes.

Doctor: K. So, Deana, tell me more about your headache.

Patient: So it started this morning, and, it has not let up. It's just gotten worse and worse and worse. And I as you can see, I can barely keep my eyes open. I'm just I it's the worst thing ever.

Doctor: So you said it started this morning.

Patient: Mhmm.

Doctor: Barely keep your eyes open. Have you ever had anything like this previously?

Patient: Never.

Doctor: Never? Okay. And when it first started in the morning, what did it feel like? Can you point?

Patient: It was mainly, like, around my forehead and temples. Yeah. It's just it just hasn't let up. It's been, I don't know, like, 6 hours now, and I just I can't even I can't even take it.

Doctor: I'm really sorry to hear that. It definitely sounds like it's been affecting you. How has it affected your just day to day since you woke up?

Patient: I haven't really been able to do anything. I just Okay. I was just like, I just need to see, my provider because I am struggling here.

Doctor: And you said it was affecting your forehead and temples, but does it move to any other part of your head or your neck?

Patient: You know, it's kinda, like, worse in the back of my head. Okay. And it's just constant. It's just like a throbbing, constant headache. And, you know, I just any, like, bright lights and loud noises, it just really, really makes it worse.

Doctor: And since it's in the morning, that throbbing pain, is it pretty consistent?

Patient: Yeah. It's been going on for what now? Like, 6 hours. So, yeah, it's pretty bad.

Doctor: Okay. And you said loud noises are making it worse. Mhmm. How about light?

Patient: Yeah. Light is really bothersome for sure. Like, these lights in here are terrible.

Doctor: And do you remember, seeing anything yesterday or the morning before such as, like, changes in your vision?

Patient: No. But I do feel like my vision's a little bit blurry right now.

Doctor: Okay. And out of both eyes or just one of your eyes?

Patient: No. Both of them.

Doctor: Both of them? Okay. And if you had to rate that throbbing pain right now on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being you wouldn't even notice and 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life, how would you rate it?

Patient: I would say 9 out of 10.

Doctor: 9 out of 10. Okay. And have you tried taking anything for this pain?

Patient: Not really. I just I've just been trying to, like, lie in a dark room. It's quiet. It seems to help a little bit but, you know, I still I still have, like, you know, just my eyes are a little bit blurry and just any light and sound just really makes it worse.

Doctor: Okay. And if you touched that part where its hurting, does that increase the pain at all?

Patient: No. It feels more like it's inside. It's not, like, on my scalp or anything.

Doctor: Okay. Okay. And next, I'm gonna ask you some questions. This might sound like a laundry list, but this is just to see if there's anything else going on that possibly tie into your headache.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Do you notice at all, any changes in your sense of smell.

Patient: No. No. I don't think my smell has been affected.

Doctor: Okay. Have you had any fevers?

Patient: No. Mm-mm. No fever.

Doctor: Okay. Any nausea?

Patient: Yes.

Doctor: Okay.

Patient: Definitely.

Doctor: Can you talk more about that?

Patient: Just, nausea. I've had, just like, you know, you feel like you're gonna throw up, but you really you just don't.

Doctor: Okay. And how about any vomiting?

Patient: I haven't really vomited yet, but I feel like I want to.

Doctor: Okay. Any diarrhea?

Patient: No. Any any necrosis? No. Not necessarily. I don't feel I feel like I can turn my head from left to right, but it just, you know, just doing anything seems to exacerbate the the pain a little bit. Just

Doctor: And, did you have any trouble sleeping the night before?

Patient: No. Mm-mm. I mean, I went to bed at the usual time that I usually go to bed and but it's just like, you know, ever since this morning when I got up, it just my headache just started and was pounding.

Patient: No. Mm-mm.

Doctor: Okay. Any changes in your diet?

Patient: No. Mm-mm. No. I usually, yeah, pretty healthy. The only thing I, you know, take, you know, I take a vitamin every day, but that's about it.

Doctor: Okay. Well, Deana, thank you for letting me ask you all those questions. I wanna move on and, just ask you more about your general medical questions.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: So to start off, are you taking any medications like a multivitamin?

Patient: No.

Doctor: No? Okay. Have you had any, hospitalizations in the past?

Patient: About 10 years ago. So I was, what, 34 years old. I had, an appendectomy, but that's about it.

Doctor: Okay. And outside of that, have you had any other surgeries or procedures?

Patient: No. Been really healthy.

Doctor: Okay. And, do you have any current medical conditions?

Patient: No.

Doctor: No, okay.

Doctor: How often do you see your primary care provider?

Patient: Not normally. Only when I have to.

Doctor: Okay. And when was your last visit if you remember?

Patient: Probably 2 years ago.

Doctor: And was everything good then?

Patient: Yeah. Seemed to be fine.

Doctor: Okay. Do you have all your current vaccinations?

Patient: Yes. Okay.

Doctor: Okay. How up to date are your COVID shots.

Patient: I'm up to date on all recommended vaccines. So

Doctor: And you mentioned that I don't have any current medical conditions, but, how about any allergies to medications?

Patient: Yeah. I'm I'm just allergic to penicillin. Oh. That's my only allergy.

Doctor: K. And what happens when you take it?

Patient: I get a rash everywhere.

Doctor: You get a rash. Okay. Okay. And how about any food allergies?

Patient: No. Mm-mm.

Doctor: Okay. So I wanna ask you a little bit more, about your family. So do you currently have any, kids?

Patient: I do have 2.

Doctor: And how old are they?

Patient: So they're, 10 and 12.

Doctor: 10 and 12? Okay. That's a fun age.

Patient: Yeah. They're a lot of fun.

Doctor: Good to hear. And, are they both healthy currently?

Patient: Yeah. Yeah. They're great.

Doctor: And are your parents still with us?

Patient: Yes. Mhmm.

Doctor: Okay. And do they have any affected conditions?

Patient: My dad had hypertension or has hypertension, and my mom has she's had a history of migraines. But other than that, they're pretty fit.

Doctor: Okay. And outside of that, are there any, diseases that you think are in your family?

Patient: No. Not that I know of. Mm-mm.

Doctor: Okay. Okay. So Deana, I wanna get to know a little bit more just about you as a person. So could you walk me through your day to day?

Patient: Yeah. So I usually get up and get the kids ready for school. I work, so I, you know, just pack my lunch and take the kids to school and go to work and, you know, it's a super stressful job but I love it. I, I work as a software developer so it's kinda high stress. Then I, you know, come home, make dinner, do laundry, clean the house, get the kids doing their homework, and, then, you know, get them make sure they're ready for the next day, get their clothes put out and, their lunches ready and bathe and then make sure they go to bed at a reasonable hour. And then I'm I might have, like, maybe 10 minutes to myself before I go to bed.

Doctor: Well, I mean, it sounds like you have a pretty full day between being a software engineer, having a whole day at work, take care of the 2 kids.

Patient: Mhmm. Yeah.

Doctor: So in the past, let's say month or 2, has work been a little bit more stressful than usual about the same

Patient: It's been it's been stressful. Yeah.

Doctor: Stressful?

Patient: Yeah. My husband's been traveling a lot, so I've kind of lost, support from, you know, his, you know, having his help in the evenings especially. So

Doctor: That definitely makes it more difficult because that all that work that you've got to share is now your responsibility. Yeah. So it's very understandable. So outside that, how has that affected your diet? Like, can you walk me through what you are eating in a typical day?

Patient: Yeah. I, you know, I I try to eat a low carb, you know, high protein diet. Basically, you know, I tried to avoid, pop and, you know, processed foods. So, I mean, I don't think it's I don't think I have a bad diet.

Doctor: And like I said, it sounds like you have a pretty full day, and there's a lot on your plate. Mhmm. But are you able to get in any exercise?

Patient: Well, I try to do the stairs at work.

Doctor: Okay.

Patient: So but other than that, not really. 

Doctor: How would you describe your mood overall?

Patient: My mood? Right now, I'm pretty frustrated because my head hurts so bad. But when I when I don't have a headache or whatever is happening, I I definitely am more cheerful.

Doctor: And these next questions. They are just between you and me. I'm here to help you. Have you ever smoked?

Patient: No. No. I'm I've never smoked. So

Doctor: That's great to hear. Glad to hear that. How about any alcohol?

Patient: I have a drink or 2 on the weekend of wine. Other than that, no.

Doctor: And have you ever had more than 3 drinks per day?

Patient: No. Mm-mm. No.

Doctor: Okay. Okay.

Patient: Do you mind if I take a drink?

Doctor: Oh, yeah. Of course. Speaking of drinks, go for it.

Patient: Thank you.

Doctor: Oh, yeah. No worries. No worries. Alright. Well, Deana, thank you for letting me ask you all those questions. What I wanna do before we finish is summarize, some of the main things I found during our visit.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: During So I need to focus on a couple of things for me. So number 1, if there's anything that I didn't that you want to emphasize, please let me know. And the other thing is anything that I misinterpreted, please correct me.

Patient: Yes.

Doctor: Okay. So to start off, you're coming in because this morning, about 6 hours ago. A very intense headache came on. This is a constant pain that you've noticed, kind of localized in your temple region kind of the front of your head, but also towards the back of your head.

Patient: Mhmm.

And you said that, this pain is 9 out of 10, and it really doesn't change throughout the day. It hasn't changed in the past 6 hours. It's pretty constant. It hasn't moved anywhere outside of those regions. So you're not feeling it in your neck, but you are feeling nauseous to the point where you feel like you're gonna throw up at some point.

Patient: Right.

Doctor: You haven't taken anything for it, but you are trying to limit, looking at bright lights, limiting your exposure to loud noises. In addition to that, you haven't tried any over the counter medications, but really just avoiding sort of

Patient: Yeah.

Doctor: Okay. And in addition to that, there's no stiffness in your neck, at all. You don't have any fevers. You don't have any chills. But really the nausea and that feeling that you're gonna vomit is there with everything going on with your head.

Patient: Mhmm.

Your mom does a history of migraines. But outside of that, your kids are both completely healthy. You are taking a multivitamin. And how often are you taking that multivitamin?

Patient: Just once a day.

Doctor: Just just once a day. Okay. And in the morning?

Patient: Yes.

Doctor: Yes. Yes. Okay. And, you did have an appendectomy 11 years ago with no other medical condition.

Patient: Just 10 years ago.

Doctor: 10 years ago. Okay. Thank you. And you Outside of that, haven't had any major dental procedures, like dental surgeries, hospitalizations, anything like that. Does that sound good? Is there anything you wanted me to clarify?

Patient: No. That's it.

Doctor: Okay. Well, Deana, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

Patient: No. No. I just, hoping that, you know, this that you can do something to make it go away.

Doctor: And with that level of headache and everything going on, I'll try to to figure out what we're doing. I'll talk to my attending, then we'll figure out a plan for you. So this way, we can get your treatment squared away.

Patient: Okay. Thank you.

Doctor: Nice meeting you. Like I said, my name is John Doe.

Patient: Nice to meet you. Thank you.
