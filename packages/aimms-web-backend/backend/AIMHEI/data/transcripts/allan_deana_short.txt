1: D: So,  good  morning.
2: P: Good  morning.
3: D: I'm  John,  John  Brown.  I'm  one  of  the  medical  students  on  the  emergency  department  service  right  now.  And  I've  been  asked  to  come  in  here  and  take  a  look  at  you  for  Dr.  Smith,  who's  the  attending.  And  so  I  was  going  to  take  some  time  and  ask  you  what  was  going  on  and  coordinate  that  into  some  notes  for  him,  if  that's  okay  with  you?  Yes,  sure.
4: P: That'd  be  great.
5: D: Well,  first,  as  I  said,  I'm  John  Brown  from  the  emergency  department.  I'm  a  third- year  medical  student,  and  I  wanted  to  double- check  your  Jane  Doe.  Is  that  correct?
6: P: Correct.
7: D: And  could  you  give  me  your  date  of  birth?
8: P: Sure.
9: D: It's  2- 10- of- 1982.
10: P: So,  February?
11: D: 10th  of  1982,  right?  And  I  see  you  have  a  bracelet  on  there.  Could  I  just  take  a  brief  look  at  that  to  see  your  medical  record  number?  Sure.  Okay,  so  let  me  just  see  if  I  got  this  right.  So,  it's  0- 9- 2- 5- 4- 6- 8- 41.  Thank  you.  Good.  I  just  wanted  to  make  sure  they  had  the  right  person.  I  wanted  to  make  sure  first  that  you're  comfortable,  and  you  are  comfortable  right  now.  You  need  coffee  or  anything?
12: P: No,  I'm  fine.
13: D: Okay,  because  this  will  take  a  few  minutes.  I  just  wanted  to  make  sure  you're  comfortable,  and  you  don't  need  to  use  the  head  or  anything  like  that.
14: P: Okay.
15: D: Okay,  so  tell  me  what  brought  you  into  the  emergency  department  today.
16: P: I've  really  had  a  headache.  I've  had  it  for  a  couple  days  now,  and  it's  really  bad.  I  just,  I'm  having  a  really  hard  time.
17: D: I'm  sorry  to  hear  that.  When  you  say  bad,  could  you  describe  that  for  me?
18: P: Yeah,  I've  had  it  for  a  really  severe,  the  past  day  or  so,  but  I've  never  had  one  that's  this  bad.  I've  had  migraines  before,  but  nothing  like  this.
19: D: So,  you  had  a  history  of  migraines?  Did  you  do,  did  you  take  medication  for  a  migraine?
20: P: No,  I  don't.
21: D: Okay,  alright.  Does  this  feel  like  your  migraine  are  very  different?
22: P: This  feels  like,  it  feels  different.  It  feels  more  severe.
23: D: Okay,  so  if  you  were  to  give  this  like  on  a  scale  of  1  out  of  10,  and  the  10  would  be  the  worst  headache  that  you've  ever  felt,  then  I  would  like  to  know,  what's  this  one,  compared  to  your  migraine?
24: P: Yeah,  I  think  I've,  as  you  know,  I've  had  headaches  before,  but  not  compared  to  this.  Like,  my  headache  is  affecting  everything.  My  daily  life,  I  just,  I  can't  stand  lights,  it  makes  it  worse.
25: D: So,  tell  me  about  what  we  call  the  photophobia,  but  it  means  lights  bothering.  Tell  me  a  little  bit  about  the  photophobia.
26: P: It  just,  it's  seeing  bright  lights  make  it  worse,  and  it  makes  like  a  stabbing  knife  pain  in  my  head.
27: D: And  what  do  you  do  to  make  that  better?
28: P: I've  just  been  lying  in  the  dark  with  the  blinds  closed,  and  no  TV,  no  cell  phone,  nothing.
29: D: Okay,  when  you  and  the  headache,  is  it  constant?  Is  it  coming,  is  it  come  and  go?  Or  what's  the  character  of  it?
30: P: No,  it's  pretty  much  just  constant.  It's  like  from  my  forehead  down  to  like  my  temple  region.  I  don't  know,  I  don't  know  why  I  have  it.  It's  kind  of  making  me  sick  to  my  stomach.  And  it  just  hasn't  gone  away.  Usually,  I'll  have  a  headache  and  it'll  go  away,  but  this  is  not  going  away.
31: D: Okay,  so  if  I  understand  this,  you  have  it  in  the  front,  you  have  it  towards  the  temple,  and  then  it's  also  associated  with  problems  handling  light.  Also,  it  sounds  like  some  nausea  and  possibly  some  vomiting.
32: D: You  said  it  was  in  the  front  and  the  temple.  Does  it  go  anywhere  else?  Does  it  radiate  anywhere  else?
33: P: Yeah,  it  kind  of  goes  to  the  back,  the  back  of  my  head.
34: D: Okay.  Alright,  to  the  back  here,  to  the  back  of  your  head.  How's  your  neck  feel?  Stiff.  Okay,  so  it's  difficult.  Is  it  harder  for  you  to  move  when  you  move?  Does  that  bother  you?
35: P: Yeah,  it  just  seems  like  any  kind  of,  you  know,  just  everything  is  affected  when  I  have  this,  you  know?  This  headache  that  I  have  right  now  just  seems  like  it's  taking  over  my  life.
36: D: Okay,  then  tell  me  the  very  first  time  you  were  aware  of  this  bad  headache.  When  did  it  start?
37: P: It  kind  of  started  suddenly  in  the  morning.  Then  it  was  just  throbbing,  and  then  I  thought,  okay,  well,  you  know,  I've  had  headaches.
